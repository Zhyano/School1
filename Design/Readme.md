This document describes School1's Appliation Design
(And really needs some formatting and proper work!)

Basic Flow:

Logging in:
	Login with userId and a password hash
	Optional userName to recover Account if none is existent
	
	Logging in works with an confirmation like-dialog on the root device, or standard password login
