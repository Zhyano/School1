# School1

School1 is an app to help students being more organized and saving time due to in-class syncing, helping them to spend less time searching for stuff, noting and keeping appointments and tasks, to have an overall more relaxed everyday life.

## Getting Started

School1 is intended to run on the most common platforms. If you like to add one, the specificaton is open, so just start developing for it. But probably you want to see or edit code for an existing platform: Have a look at the sections [Branches](#branches) and [Platforms](#platforms).

Also, it aims to provide an excellent, platform specific UI to be intuitive and easy to use, yet powerful, optimal both in terms of performance and user experience, open to innovation and completely free.
